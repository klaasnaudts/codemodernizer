  title : "The ultimate tool for keeping your code <br>up-to-date"
  content : "CodeModernizer is a software tool that employs semi-automated techniques to evolve your Java code over time. This way, it delivers longer-lasting, more sustainable code and software. The main aspects of the code that CodeModernizer updates are language constructs, use of latest JDK features, use of recent version of dependent libraries, and modernization of build scripts.

  <br><br>
  
  Before any of the first three can run, the code will be run through ‘regularization’: irregular constructs, which can generally be viewed as “sloppy programming”, are transformed to more conventional ones."

    - "images/undraw/undraw_personal_file_re_5joy.svg"
    content : "Software development, as well as languages like Java never stop evolving. Because of that, it is extremely important your code evolves along, so that it lasts longer and doesn't have to be replaced every couple of years.

Why is this so beneficial? Here are a couple of reasons, and for even more information and benefits, visit the [product page](products/product-codemodernizer/).

  - Every decade brings along new trends, but existing code doesn't have to loose value if it gets modernized regularly.

  - New programmers recognize more recent patterns, and don't want to work with code that hasn't evolved for decades.

  - Java evolves naturally, in a good way. It really isn't that hard to let your code evolve alongside it.

  - More compact and more readable code means cheaper maintenance."
