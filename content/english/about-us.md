  title: "Who we are?"
  content: "Both CodeModernizer and e2immu have been created by Bart Naudts, a software engineer working with Java for more than  two decades, and subsequently fall under the IBTECH BV company. After working together with countless programmers on numerous projects, the need for a tool that modernizes and updates code was an obviously visible. With the help from some collaborators, the product CodeModernizer is being realized, alongside the open-source e2immu project."

  title: "Our mission"
  content: "Our mission is to make a lasting impact on the programming world with tools for code that lasts longer and that is more sustainable.
  
  
  Code and software development is often not long-term focused. However, this model of building systems that last a couple of years and have to be redesigned, rewritten and replaced is far from sustainable and efficient. We believe this can be done differently."
