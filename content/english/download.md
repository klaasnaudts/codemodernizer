    content : "Those who will gain the most benefit out of using CodeModernizer are companies who own a Java software base that is valuable to them, one they intend to continue to use for many years to come.

    The service is especially interesting to those who cannot afford or do not want to assign programmers to do regular maintenance on the code. In a time where coders are in high demand, you would rather have them implement new features instead of keeping the Java software base modern and up-to-date."
