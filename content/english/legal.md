#### Data protection

[ legal way of saying we will only use your data for necessary uses + GDPR ]

#### Protection of your code

In summary, there are two ways the CodeModernizer software can be used. 

1. Firstly, you can just download CodeModernizer, pay for a license, and get going. Individuals or companies opting for this option will have a guarantee that IBTECH will never get the chance to see the code that CodeModernizer analyzes since the code transformer and standard transformation library can be run locally inside of your own organization, using our binary. The binary writes to a different branch of the source code management system, and we guarantee that the binary does not communicate over the internet, so your code is as secure as it can be.
2. If you opt for custom work for your specific situation, IBTECH will need to have a view on the parts of the code that need modernizing. A non-disclosure agreement will be signed if such a view is to be granted. For more information concerning consulting, and data protection in that case, send us a mail over at info@codemodernizer.com
