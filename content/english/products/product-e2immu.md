    content : "##### Customizable Annotated APIs


    Bend, or sharpen, the modification rules yourself: Annotated APIs determine how you view library code.

    ##### Plugins

    A plugin for IntelliJ lets you see the immutability status of your classes in your IDE. The Gradle plugin runs the analyser.

    <br><br>

    ##### No magic!

    Learn the concepts and use the support classes. The analyser is there to help, but it is not required.
