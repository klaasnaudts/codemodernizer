Right now, CodeModernizer still is in development. This means that whilst we are working hard, no downloadable software is yet available. However, we do have a roadmap and timeline with the goals of where we want CodeModernizer to be in the future. 

- By the end of 2021, custom consulting jobs can be done for companies interested in the services CodeModernizer offers, but completely personalized.
- In the summer of 2022, a first downloadable version should be available for early adopters.
- By the end of 2022, CodeModernizer will be available at full price for the first time.
