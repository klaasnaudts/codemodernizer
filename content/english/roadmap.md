    content : "Right now, CodeModernizer is not yet finished or far enough to publically release a first version. However, if the premise of CodeModernizer sounds interesting, we can provide the same results that the program would give through consultancy. A combination of decades of expertise and knowledge in Java in combination with our early version of CodeModernizer will evolve and modernizer your codebase to make it better and future-proof."

This version will not be paid yet, since we do not believe it is right to ask money for a product that is not yet finished. However, you will be able to download the work-in-progress version (for free) and try CodeModernizer out yourself!"

    content : "The last phase of our roadmap for CodeModernizer sees the full release of the program. With the full release. Along with this we will also introduce pricing plans, which will fit accordingly for the different types of users of CodeModernizer."
