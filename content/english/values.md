#### Mission and Vision

> Our mission is to make a lasting impact on the programming world with tools for code that lasts longer and that is more sustainable.

Code and software development is often not long-term focused. However, this model of building systems that last a couple of years and have to be redesigned, rewritten and replaced is far from sustainable and efficient. 

Even though the (Java) programming world is constantly evolving and changing, this should not mean code has to lose value and become outdated. Older code generally has fewer bugs and more, finer, details have been implemented over time. Replacing it with new code just because the existing code is becoming 'old' is inefficient, time and resource wasteful, and almost always more expensive.

As the programming language evolves over time, so do the programmers. Younger and new programmers might not easily recognize old software patterns, and also don't feel motivated to try to figure out code that hasn't been updated for decades. What we propose is letting the code evolve with the language - and programmers, so that it does not have to be replaced. Rather, it can last decades by modernizing it. This way, programmers can also learn from the changes CodeModernizer proposes.

> Our vision is to help standardize and transform code so that it can last for decades, and to educate experienced and beginning programmers.



#### Sustainability Through Software (sustainability of code)

What do we mean with sustainability through software? This mainly means creating software that is aimed at being used long term, code that lasts through trends and retains its value. Sustainable software, at the same time, also concerns the use of resources. Not having to manually re-write code means saving human resources, but also saves energy. Using existing code offers other advantages, like the fact that the finer details of the code are conserved, which in turn saves time and resources. 

Another way in which we can make code more efficient, and longer lasting, is by making it more compact and readable. A good code base should last through multiple, different generations of programmers at a company. If the code is kept compact, readable, and up-to-date, lots of time and precious resources can be preserved when new coders have to take over the work of the existing ones.



#### Education, Open Source, and Sharing of Knowledge

Education is one of the core values of CodeModernizer. The use of our tools is not only beneficial for the code base and the software, but also for the developers themselves. The world of Java programming is ever evolving and changing, and it is impossible for every developer to keep up with every new trend, library, feature, etc. Programmers who use CodeModernizer are able to see ways in which their code can be improved upon, which also helps them to keep evolving and learning as software engineers.

At the same time we also want to give back to the open source community that has been the backbone of the programming world for years. The amount of software projects that have been realized with the help of open source software is countless, and the world wouldn't be the same without them.

We want as much people using the software as possible, even if they do not necessarily have the funds to do so. That's why we offer our software for free to students, people employed at educational institutions, and software developers actively working on an open source project. 



#### Support for Open Source

The support for open source goes even further: CodeModernizer uses the open source [e2immu.org](http://e2immu.org) project, a static code analyzer that focuses on modification and immutability. If you want to get your hands dirty yourself, give using e2immu a shot, or even contribute to the project itself.
